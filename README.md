# Hash Table

This is an computer program that creates an hash table which can be constructed in three different types that are linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing. Please look at the pdf file to understand how it works and what is the output. You can send me an e-mail if you have any questions or suggesstions ( osmanbugraaydin@gmail.com ).

### Installation

- Type just "make" in the terminal
- Type "./simulator_Q1 [ your input file ] [ type of hash table ] [ size of hash table ]"
- ##### For example:

- ./simulator_Q1 inputs.txt LINEAR 23
- ./simulator_Q1 inputs.txt QUADRATIC 31
- ./simulator_Q1 inputs.txt DOUBLE 29
- THEN YOU HAVE THE OUTPUT :)


#### There are lots of functions. Please look at the pdf file to understand basics of hash tables.
    
Details about the program can be found in the pdf file.
